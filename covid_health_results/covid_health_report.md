- **Case Fatality Rate**: 1.0 per 1000 cases
- **Cases per Million**: 35
- **Deaths per Million**: 0
- **COVID Performance Score**: 0.11

## 💡 Key Insights
1. **Higher health expenditure associated with lower case fatality rates**: Investment in healthcare pays off
2. **Higher physician density associated with lower case fatality rates**: Medical workforce matters
3. **COVID-19 performance varies significantly**: No one-size-fits-all approach to pandemic response
4. **Health system resilience is complex**: Multiple factors contribute to pandemic outcomes

## 🎯 Policy Implications
1. **Invest in healthcare infrastructure**: Strong health systems are crucial for crisis response
2. **Focus on quality, not just quantity**: Physician density alone doesn't guarantee better outcomes
3. **Prepare for future pandemics**: Build resilient health systems
4. **Learn from successful countries**: Study what worked in different contexts

## 🎯 Conclusion
This analysis reveals the complex relationship between health system characteristics and COVID-19 outcomes.
While health expenditure and physician density show some correlations with performance, many other factors influence pandemic response.
The findings emphasize the importance of building comprehensive, resilient health systems for future crises.
